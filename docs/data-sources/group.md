# ad_group (Data Source)

Retrieves information about an Active Directory group. Supports multiple lookup methods: objectGUID, Distinguished Name, common name with container, or SAM account name.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# AD Group Data Source Examples

terraform {
  required_providers {
    ad = {
      source = "isometry/ad"
    }
  }
}

provider "ad" {
  domain   = "example.com"
  username = "admin@example.com"
  password = "secure_password"
}

# Lookup by Distinguished Name (most precise)
data "ad_group" "by_dn" {
  dn = "cn=IT Team,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com"
}

# Lookup by GUID (most reliable)
data "ad_group" "by_guid" {
  id = "12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789012"
}

# Lookup by SAM Account Name (domain-wide search)
data "ad_group" "by_sam" {
  sam_account_name = "ITTeam"
}

# Use group data in membership resource
resource "ad_group_membership" "add_members" {
  group_id = data.ad_group.by_dn.id
  members = [
    "newuser@example.com",
    "cn=service-account,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  ]
}

# Use group attributes in new resources
resource "ad_group" "support_team" {
  name        = "IT Support Team"
  container   = dirname(data.ad_group.by_dn.dn)
  description = "Support team within ${data.ad_group.by_dn.name}"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `container` (String) The container DN where the group is located. Required when using the `name` lookup method. Example: `CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com`
- `dn` (String) The Distinguished Name of the group to retrieve. Example: `CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com`
- `flatten_members` (Boolean) If set to true, returns a flattened list of users only (excludes groups) from recursive group membership. This traverses nested group membership to return all user members. When false or unset, the `members` attribute contains direct members only (users and groups).
- `id` (String) The objectGUID of the group to retrieve. This is the most reliable lookup method as objectGUIDs are immutable and unique. Format: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- `name` (String) The common name (cn) of the group to retrieve. When using this lookup method, the `container` attribute must also be specified to avoid ambiguity. Example: `Domain Admins`
- `sam_account_name` (String) The SAM account name (pre-Windows 2000 name) of the group to retrieve. This performs a domain-wide search. Example: `Domain Admins`

### Read-Only

- `category` (String) The category of the group. Valid values: `security`, `distribution`.
- `description` (String) The description of the group.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the group (equivalent to common name).
- `mail` (String) The email address for distribution groups.
- `mail_nickname` (String) The Exchange mail nickname for distribution groups.
- `managed_by` (String) Distinguished Name (DN) of the user or computer that manages this group.
- `member_count` (Number) The total number of members in the group.
- `member_of` (Set of String) A set of Distinguished Names of groups that this group is a member of. This represents nested group membership.
- `members` (Set of String) A set of Distinguished Names of all group members. Includes users, groups, and other objects.
- `scope` (String) The scope of the group. Valid values: `global`, `universal`, `domainlocal`.
- `sid` (String) The Security Identifier (SID) of the group.
- `when_changed` (String) The timestamp when the group was last modified (RFC3339 format).
- `when_created` (String) The timestamp when the group was created (RFC3339 format).
