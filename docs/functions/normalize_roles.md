# function: normalize_roles

For each team in the teams map, normalizes fields matching role keys to sets.

- String values become single-element sets
- Lists become sets (duplicates removed)
- Existing sets are preserved
- Null/empty values become empty sets
- Fields not matching role keys remain unchanged
