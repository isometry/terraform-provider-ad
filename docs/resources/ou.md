# ad_ou (Resource)

Manages an Active Directory organizational unit (OU). OUs are used to organize other Active Directory objects in a hierarchical structure for administrative purposes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# AD Organizational Unit Examples

terraform {
  required_providers {
    ad = {
      source = "isometry/ad"
    }
  }
}

provider "ad" {
  domain   = "example.com"
  username = "admin@example.com"
  password = "secure_password"
}

# Basic OU at domain root
resource "ad_ou" "departments" {
  name        = "Departments"
  path        = "dc=example,dc=com"
  description = "Company departments"
}

# Nested OU structure
resource "ad_ou" "it_department" {
  name        = "IT Department"
  path        = ad_ou.departments.dn
  description = "Information Technology Department"
}

resource "ad_ou" "it_groups" {
  name        = "Groups"
  path        = ad_ou.it_department.dn
  description = "IT Department groups"
}

# Protected OU (cannot be accidentally deleted)
resource "ad_ou" "service_accounts" {
  name                  = "Service Accounts"
  path                  = ad_ou.it_department.dn
  description           = "Critical service accounts"
  protect_from_deletion = true
}

# Using OU as container for groups
resource "ad_group" "it_admins" {
  name        = "IT Administrators"
  container   = ad_ou.it_groups.dn
  description = "IT Department administrators"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the organizational unit. This becomes the CN component of the distinguished name.
- `path` (String) The distinguished name of the parent container where the OU will be created (e.g., `dc=example,dc=com` or `ou=Parent,dc=example,dc=com`).

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description for the organizational unit. This is optional and can be used to provide additional context about the OU's purpose.
- `managed_by` (String) Distinguished Name (DN) of the user or computer that manages this organizational unit. Must be a valid DN format (e.g., `CN=User,OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com`).
- `protected` (Boolean) Whether the OU is protected from accidental deletion. When true, the OU cannot be deleted until protection is disabled. Defaults to `false`.

### Read-Only

- `dn` (String) The distinguished name of the OU. This is automatically generated based on the name and path.
- `guid` (String) The objectGUID of the OU in string format. This is the same value as the `id` attribute.
- `id` (String) The objectGUID of the OU. This is automatically assigned by Active Directory and used as the unique identifier.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import examples for ad_ou resource
# OUs can be imported using various identifier formats

# Import by Distinguished Name
terraform import ad_ou.departments "ou=Departments,dc=example,dc=com"

# Import by GUID (ObjectGUID)
terraform import ad_ou.it_department "12345678-1234-5678-9012-123456789012"

# Import by SID
terraform import ad_ou.critical_systems "S-1-5-21-123456789-123456789-123456789-1001"
```
